** DESCRIPTION **
A simple and customisable playwright program. This program adds items to the woolworths shopping cart without signing in - Using the collection option instead of delivery. This is for the mundane task I find myself doing , whcih is adding items to my basket everytime I got to the shop instead of writing a shopping list. I have added a few items to the cart and viewed them , secondly I have added a second test to view/search vegetarian recipes on the What's For Dinner website.
